## Welcome to Week 1  
In this week unfortunately you will mostly be waiting for your date, your raspi to reach you.  

Till then you should equip yourselves with some basic knowledge and equipment that will be necessary and required if you want to make a good starting impression on your Pi for a quicker vibe match. 

Two things that are absolutely essential for the setup:
- #### [A micro SD card (16/32 GB)](https://www.electronicscomp.com/sandisk-16gb-micro-sd-class-10-memory-card?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4qJyYGtevyWS9vk2YxI-KO0CI94yL61LXhTIkSMM_A4bVSz2vBQ7ORoCvyMQAvD_BwE)
- #### [A USB micro SD card reader](https://robu.in/product/high-speed-micro-sd-card-reader/) / [Micro SD to SD adapter](https://www.electronicscomp.com/micro-sd-card-to-sd-card-adapter?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4hRQZidPAMSlSeCKCImgckruIjQrcGgYYepyHxPZHs5w5DmiE_UHFxoCOvEQAvD_BwE)
<br>  

(Optional)  
- [A **mini** HDMI cable](https://robu.in/product/mini-hdmi-hdmi-cable-1-8-meter-round-high-quality-copper-clad-steel-black/?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4tvtgJJqFPk4m_dOh7G3nNOEib2_UDptqPVcpDndM34MuhmiHZtU_xoC-P8QAvD_BwE) (only if you want a desktop like experience, nothing fancy) 

It will be better to procure these from some local shop at prices cheaper than the above links.

### Revision Time
Now its time to brush up on your Linux skills since the Raspbian OS is totally based on Linux.  
Check out this meticulously compiled list of [essential Linux commands](https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/ROS-Specialization-22/blob/main/week1/LinuxCommands.md)  
<br>
<br>  
### SSH (Secure Shell)  
Ever heard this term before? Think of it as a tool which allows you to connect remotely to any other device using only its ip address/hostname. 
[Check out this video for a basic understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfYZR6opTVg)  
  
So once you have successfully entered your target device you can literally do anything you want-transfer files,copy files,erase files you have absolute control.  
SSH works on windows too in a similar fashion although it is very very much recommended that you dual boot your system with Ubuntu 20.04.

<br>
Now you know everything you need to start setting up your Pi. Hopefully by now it has arrived and best of luck for your first meeting.
