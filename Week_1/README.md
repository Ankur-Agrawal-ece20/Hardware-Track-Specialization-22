## Welcome to Week 1  
In this week unfortunately you will mostly be waiting for your date, your raspi to reach you.  

Till then you should equip yourselves with some basic knowledge and equipment that will be necessary and required if you want to make a good starting impression on your Pi for a quicker vibe match. 

Two things that are absolutely essential for the setup:
- #### [A micro SD card (16/32 GB)](https://www.electronicscomp.com/sandisk-16gb-micro-sd-class-10-memory-card?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4qJyYGtevyWS9vk2YxI-KO0CI94yL61LXhTIkSMM_A4bVSz2vBQ7ORoCvyMQAvD_BwE)
- #### [A USB micro SD card reader](https://robu.in/product/high-speed-micro-sd-card-reader/) / [Micro SD to SD adapter](https://www.electronicscomp.com/micro-sd-card-to-sd-card-adapter?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4hRQZidPAMSlSeCKCImgckruIjQrcGgYYepyHxPZHs5w5DmiE_UHFxoCOvEQAvD_BwE)
<br>  

(Optional)  
- [A **mini** HDMI cable](https://robu.in/product/mini-hdmi-hdmi-cable-1-8-meter-round-high-quality-copper-clad-steel-black/?gclid=CjwKCAjw46CVBhB1EiwAgy6M4tvtgJJqFPk4m_dOh7G3nNOEib2_UDptqPVcpDndM34MuhmiHZtU_xoC-P8QAvD_BwE) (only if you want a desktop like experience, nothing fancy) 

Its will be better to procure these from some local shop at prices cheaper than the above links.
