<b>We know you are too shy to speak, so why don't you tell it in sign language?</b>

## Prerequisites
- **Python:** We hope that all of you are familiar with python, if not do checkout this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw">video</a>.
- **Camera Integration:** Next step is to do camera integration with raspi, here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzYGDq0D1mw">tutorial</a>.

## Your Task
All you need to do is to take input from the camera module by showing it hand signs and write a `python code` so that raspi can decode your message. <br>
Show three different hand signs and map them to words `I`, `LIKE` and `YOU` , ofcourse in this given order. <br>
Your message will begin with completely stretched hand position and end with it only.

</p>

All signs between them will be your message and again its obvious that you cannot use this sign for other purposes.
<br><br>
**A small hint from our side, do checkout mediapipe package of python.**

## Your submission
You need to record a short video inside your raspi, that starts and end with given sign. Your current meaning of sign should be visible on video as you can see in above images.<br> <br>
Make sure to avoid high resolution and long videos to prevent memory card from getting full. <br>
You will recieve submission link at the end of this week. Till then...
